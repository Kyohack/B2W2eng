Glad you came!\xfffeYour \xf000\x0102\x0001\x0000's doing just fine.
Glad you came!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeYour \xf000\x0102\x0001\x0000 and\xfffe\xf000\x0102\x0001\x0001 are doing just fine.\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeThe two seem to get along very well!

Ah, it's you!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeWe were raising your Pokémon,\xfffeand my goodness, were we surprised!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeYour Pokémon was holding an Egg!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeWe don't know how it got there,\xfffebut your Pokémon had it.\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeYou do want it, don't you?
\xf000\x0100\x0001\x0000 received the Egg from\xfffethe Day-Care Man.
You take good care of it.
You have no room for it right now...\xfffeCome back when you've made room.
I really will keep it.\xfffeYou do want this Egg, yes?
Well then, I'll hang on to it.\xfffeThanks!
I'm the Day-Care Lady.\xfffeWe can raise Pokémon for you.\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeWould you like us to raise\xfffeyour Pokémon?
I'm the Day-Care Lady.\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeWe can raise Pokémon for you.\xfffeWhat do you want to do today?
Very good.\xfffeCome again.
Ah, there you are!\xfffeMy husband was looking for you.
You can't leave your only Pokémon\xfffewith me! How would you battle?\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeCome back another time.
Which Pokémon should we raise\xfffefor you?\xf000\xbe01\x0000
Now, now.\xfffeThat is merely an Egg!
Fine, we'll raise your \xf000\x0102\x0001\x0000\xfffefor a while.\xf000\xbe01\x0000
Come back for it later.
We can raise two of your Pokémon.\xfffeWould you like us to raise another?
You have energetic Pokémon.\xfffeDo you want your Pokémon back?
By level, your \xf000\x0101\x0001\x0000 has\xfffegrown by about \xf000\x0201\x0001\x0001.\xf000\xbe01\x0000
If you want your \xf000\x0101\x0001\x0000 back,\xfffeit will cost $\xf000\x0204\x0001\x0001.\xf000\xbe00\x0000\xfffeDo you want it back?
You don't have enough money...
\xf000\x0100\x0001\x0001 took \xf000\x0101\x0001\x0000 back\xfffefrom the Day-Care Lady.\xf000\xbe01\x0000
Do you want to take back the other\xfffeone, too? 
Huh? Now, now.\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeIf you leave that Pokémon with\xfffeme, you'll be left with just one.\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeYou will be better off if you catch\xfffesome more, if I do say so myself.
