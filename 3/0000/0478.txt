But, it seems you could not\xfffecatch any Pokémon.\xf000븁\x0000
Ugh...\xfffeThere seems to be a communication error.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm afraid you have to try it again!\xf000븁\x0000
Hi, hello!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou came here.\xfffeThat means you are a visitor?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeHuh? No?\xfffeYou came all the way here?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAh, you are a Trainer?\xfffeAre you in the middle of your journey?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAh, this is your Trainer Card?\xf000븁\x0000

Yahoooooooooooooooo!\xf000븁\x0000
What a great day! Great! Unbelievable!\xfffeHi, I am Professor Andrew Park!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou!\xfffeEr...\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000!\xf000븁\x0000
\xf000Ā\x0001\x0000! Are you willing to\xfffeparticipate in an ambitious experiment\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethat will make history?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThis device is called Poké Transfer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt connects...blah blah blah...\xfffe...called DS system...meanwhile...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...blah blah...of molecules...and then...\xfffe...while evoking...blah blah...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...ergo, energy particles will...\xfffe...blah blah...and if the frequency...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...as you see...with faraway Pokémon...\xfffe...the Alpha waves...blah blah...\xf000븁\x0000\xfffe...following which...reach convergence...\xfffe...blah blah...spectacular results!\xf000븁\x0000
To put it more simply, if you use this\xfffedevice, you may be able to bring Pokémon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffehere from other regions.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut just for safety's sake, the Pokémon\xfffeyou're transferring shouldn't be holding\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeanything! So make sure to take their\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeitems first.\xf000븁\x0000
...So! You!\xf000븁\x0000
You are a fantastic Pokémon Trainer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWill you participate in the great\xfffeexperiment of the century?\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou need two DS systems to use\xfffePoké Transfer!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe will conduct the experiment with\xfffeanother DS. Is that OK?
Your Pokémon can't be holding items when\xfffeyou transfer them. It's safer that way.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn rare cases, there are Pokémon that\xfffecannot be transferred, but\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeProfessor Park will explain it to you.
With this research of mine, I also want to\xfffehave an impact on people in the future...\xf000븀\x0000\xfffepeople living 100 or 200 years from now!
Here, we are monitoring Poké Transfer.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeWe're keeping a careful eye to make sure\xfffeall the Pokémon have safe travels!
