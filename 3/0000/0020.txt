I'm only raising\xfffeFire-type Pokemon.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeI'm weak against water, ground and rock\xfffePokemon and moves.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut thinking of counterattacks\xfffeis what makes being a  trainer fun!
Sometimes I find interesting Pokemon in the PC\xfffeSo I raise them!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIf I don't raise them\xfffeI'll never know if they are good!
Gulp!
