Hey! Is there anything you'd like \xfffeto know about Pokewood?\xfffe
Filming a Pokewood Movie\xfffefollows rules and procedures!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn other words, a scene\xfffeis the foundation to making a movie!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe conditions for filming\xfffea successful scene involve\xf000븀\x0000\xfffecertain scene specific conditions\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand information about your costars!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou can check things out even while filming\xfffeso if you don't know what to do, check to be sure!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIn scenes you can challenge\xfffewill gradually increase\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedepending on the content of the films you make,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffethe box office take, and various other things!\xf000븁\x0000
In Pokewood films,\xfffepokemon don't miss!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeIt's all based on\xfffethe technical team and the pokemon's acting.\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeFor each scene,\xfffeyou can rent pokemon to use!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeAnd once you finish\xfffea successful scene,\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeyou can use your own pokemon\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeand have them be a part of the film!\xf000븁\x0000
Basically, a Pokewood scene\xfffeis much like a pokemon battle!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeBut that doesn't mean\xfffethat defeating your opponent\xf000븀\x0000\xfffeis always the best thing to do!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThere are hints written\xfffein each scene, so\xf000븀\x0000\xfffepay really close attention!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeYou should also check and\xfffelisten to what the director has to say!\xf000븁\x0000
As the scene goes on,\xfffeyou'll be able to choose your lines!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeChoose the lines\xfffethat you think sound great!\xf000븁\x0000\xfffeThe performance of your costars\xfffeand the final production\xf000븀\x0000\xfffewill all change\xf000븀\x0000\xfffedepending on the lines you pick!\xf000븁\x0000
