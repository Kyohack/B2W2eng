Hey! Trainer!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeBefore I knew it, these rocks\xfffewere already here... \xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeIt'd take superhuman strength to\xfffepush these away...
There's no way those were\xfffeCrustle Pokémon...\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeIf those were Crustle, then they should\xfffebe in the desert at the Desert Resort!
Those rocks are huge... but a Pokémon\xfffe should be able to move them!
Colress: I've been waiting for you!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeWhat should we do?\xfffeThink it's better in back?\xf000\xbe01\x0000
These are not rocks, but\xfffePokémon called Crustle.\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffePlease watch!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeI made a device that\xfffestimulates Pokémon.\xf000\xbe01\x0000
Pchoooo!
Colress: ...I wonder if the Crustle \xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffecarried the rocks here\xfffebecause they were exhausted?\xf000\xbe01\x0000
...That "Team Plasma"\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeThey thought Pokémon could only reach\xfffetheir true potential if they were\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffereleased from human control.\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeI do not think that way!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeRather, humans should bring out the\xfffehidden powers of Pokémon!\xf000\xbe01\x0000
Which reminds me, I didn't exactly catch\xfffeyour name, did I?\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffe... ... ...\xfffe... ... ...\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffe\xf000\x0100\x0001\x0000, was it?\xfffeI'll make sure to rememeber that name!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeWell then, \xf000\x0100\x0001\x0000, \xfffemake sure you bring out the true power\xf000\xbe00\x0000\xfffeof your Pokémon!\xf000\xbe01\x0000
Colress: I see! You, much like\xfffevarious gym leaders,\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffethe Pokémon League's Elite Four,\xfffeand even the Champion,\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeall cherish your Pokémon!\xfffeThat is how you derive your strength!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeSo it seems those those types of people\xfffeare actually quite similar!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeI am indebted to you.\xfffeTake this as a sign of my gratitude.\xf000\xbe01\x0000
Colress: How troublesome!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeI want to unravel the power of Pokémon!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeFor the sake of Pokémon, I'd like to\xfffetalk to you again!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffe...There's no reason people can't be\xfffelike you!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeSo then, \xf000\x0100\x0001\x0000,\xfffeuntil we meet again!\xf000\xbe01\x0000
*low rumble*
Braviary flew away\xfffeinto the sky...
Cars move quckly on the freeway!\xfffeI can't stop watching them!
Because they found some ruins,\xfffedevelopment has be halted...\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeI wonder if their importance\xfffewas too great to handle?
Oops! Trainer\xfffeLook at the color of the sand!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeSee how there's both dark\xfffeand light colored sand?\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeIn the dark colored sand,\xfffethere are hidden Pokémon!

Trainer Tips!\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffe\xfffePokémon have a source of energy\xfffefor using moves.\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeIt's called PP, meaning Power Points.\xfffeThey have PP for each move.\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeWhen a move has no PP remaining,\xfffethat Pokémon cannot use that move.\xf000\xbe01\x0000\xfffeThat's a good time to head for\xfffethe Pokémon Center!
