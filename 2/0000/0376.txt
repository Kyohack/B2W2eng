Have we met or not? I don't remember.\xfffeWell, nice to meet you!
Yahoo! Ya-hoooooo!\xfffeI won again!
No way! Nooo way...\xfffeI lost again...
All right!\xfffeI will show you my power!
Amazed? Surprised?\xfffeBy the power of my Pokémon?!
You are incredible!\xfffeI am astonished and surprised!
May... May I help you?!
Oh! Oh!\xfffeYes, we can?!
Un-un-unbelievable!
Don't let your guard down,\xfffeor you may cry when a kid beats you...
I may be young, but I don't think\xfffeI will lose, even against grown-ups.
Fweh! I am just a kid!\xfffeYou are fighting for keeps!
Let's have an awesome\xfffePokémon battle!
Mmmph! Mmmmmph!\xfffeYou see, it's fun to win!
You are pretty amazing!\xfffeAnd you have totally exhausted me...
Very serious from the very beginning.\xfffeAre you ever really prepared for this?
Seriously, winning a serious battle is\xfffeseriously great!
Seriously, I lost. I am seriously depressed.\xfffeBut you are seriously cool.
Go easy on me!\xfffeThis is my first battle...
I can't believe I won my first battle!\xfffeSay, did you go easy on me?
Ouch! That hurts!!\xfffeBut... You are great...
You... You know,\xfffethese Pokémon are my friends.
I... I... I am sorry...\xfffeI just wanted to introduce them to you.
Just being with these Pokémon\xfffemakes me happy...
...Heehee. I'm confident in calculation\xfffeand analysis.
Heheh. Exactly as I planned...\xfffeI don't feel like losing.
Ohhhh... Calculation and analysis\xfffeare no match for coincidence...
We're about to have a Pokémon battle.\xfffeAt the very least, we say hello!
That could have gone better,\xfffebut thank you very much.
I feel like crying in frustration,\xfffebut thank you very much.
I am studying every single day...\xfffeSo I am taking a break for a change.
You see, playing with Pokémon is fun.\xfffeI want to study Pokémon.
Ah, my Pokémon lost...\xfffeI may be better at studying.
I want to be a Pokémon research\xfffescientist when I grow up.
I'm wondering if Pokémon research\xfffeprojects require test subjects...
I must do my best to learn\xfffemore about Pokémon.
Ah... You look strong...\xfffeI hope I will be all right...
Oops, you were not as strong\xfffeas I expected... Looks can be deceiving.
I could tell you are a strong Trainer!\xfffeWhat you see is what you get.
I always get the best grades!\xfffeI will try to be No. 1 for everything!
I will keep winning, winning, winning...\xfffeI will be No. 1!
If I lose at such an early stage,\xfffeI cannot be No. 1.
Wha--? You wanna fight with me?\xfffeI suppoooose...
Ah, I shoulda known.\xfffeDon't blame me.
Oh, wow. I am no match for you.\xfffeYour Pokémon are great.
Mrrrrr... Mmrr grrr...\xfffeGrrrrr... Mrrrrr...
Grrrrr... Mmrrrr...\xfffe...Oh? Did I win?
Grrrrmmm... Mrrr...\xfffeOh? Is that it?
Here I am, a master of the universe and\xfffethe mover and shaker of the future!
The class differences always tell.\xfffeI am worried about your future prospects.
I got carried away.\xfffeI am worried about my future prospects.
Are you my opponent?\xfffeYou look kind of hungry.
Have you eaten well?\xfffeYou cannot do well on an empty stomach.
Are you really an ordinary person?\xfffeWhat do you eat?
I am a nouveau riche celebrity,\xfffeso I am stingy with my money!
Unfortunately, you lost.\xfffeNow, give me your lunch money!
I lost, but I won't give you\xfffemy lunch money!
My mom chose my Pokémon.\xfffeI don't think I will lose.
You see! I am fine as long as\xfffeI listen to my mom.
Mommy! Mommy! Where are you?\xfffePlease come and hug me!
A Trainer who looks gorgeous!\xfffeI hope your battle is just as beautiful.
Such a looker lost against me?!\xfffeI am a little disappointed.
Oh my, the battle was also gorgeous.\xfffeI find myself drawn to you.
What kind of Pokémon do you like?\xfffeHey, hey. Let me see!
Your taste in Pokémon is excellent, \xfffebut you are a disappointment as a Trainer.
Your taste in Pokémon is truly awful,\xfffebut you are a first-class Trainer!
I am sorry--I lied.\xfffeI am not a rich girl.
Everybody paid more attention to me\xfffewhen I pretended to be rich.
The truth is I am just the daughter\xfffeof a Clerk ⑭.
Ahaha...
Ahahaha...
Argh...
Preschooler gonna battle you!\xfffeNice to meet you.
Little baby is a winna!\xfffeTank you! Tank you!
Da Preschooler lost!\xfffeTank you anyways!
I am a genius Preschooler!\xfffeI am already prepping for college.
You lost against a Preschooler...\xfffeHow old are you again?
I am confident in studying, but\xfffeI am just a beginner in Pokémon battles.
I am a hero!\xfffeI refuse to lose!
I AM a hero!\xfffeI beat the bad person!
A hero never loses.\xfffeA hero never dies.
I am very strong.\xfffeI will never lose.
Daddy gave me these Pokémon!\xfffeThey've got to be strong!
AAAAAAAAAH!
I thinks it are strange\xfffeit complaining when they lose.
When I win, I are glad!\xfffeHip, hip, hurray!
Boo!! I did lost... I are frustrated,\xfffebut I guess things my own fault.
Are you going to bully me?
You didn't bully me. I like you!
You bullied me, but I like you\xfffe'cause you are strong!
Gmmmmm! Pokémon!\xfffeGive it all you've got!
Mmmmph! Yahoo! Yahoo!\xfffeThank you very much, Pokémon!
Boooooo! Come on, Pokémon.\xfffeTry harder!
I am four years old! I will do my best!\xfffeTrainer, do your best, too!
I am four years old! I did my best!\xfffeTrainer, you are weak.
I am four years old! I did my best!\xfffeTrainer, you did your best, too!
Lalalala... Lalalala...\xfffeI am a loner...
Lalalala... Lalalala...\xfffeDrifting like clouds...
Lalalala... Lalalala...\xfffeUntil I see you again...
I am not an ordinary Backpacker,\xfffe'cause I am a newlywed.
'Cause my wife and I have no money,\xfffewe're hitchhiking on our honeymoon.
This trip is our honeymoon!\xfffeBut I wandered off from my wife...
I am in the middle of my penniless travel.\xfffeIt has its own charm.
Travel is best when you are poor\xfffeand when you are young.
Aww... I am hungry...\xfffePlease spare something...
Argh! My backpack is heavy!\xfffeWhy is it so heavy?
Why is this backpack so heavy?\xfffeDid you put something in it?
Arrrgh! Why didn't you wait\xfffeuntil I put down my bag?!
I wanted a short trip to heal my broken\xfffeheart, but it's been a few months now...
A trip cannot heal my heartbreak...
I have no home to return to,\xfffeso maybe I will live as a drifter...
Hm. I wonder who you are.\xfffeI wonder if you'll have a battle with me.
You... You are weak.\xfffeOr am I just strong?
You are strong.\xfffeI wanna run away.
Sometimes I need a little time to rest.\xfffeI will relax here!
That was a nice, refreshing time.\xfffeI will work hard tomorrow!
That was supposed to be refreshing.\xfffeNow I am more stressed out.
I hope to work hard, save money,\xfffeand have a quiet life.
Everybody has a different dream.\xfffeI just want to have a normal life.
I want to have security and happiness\xffferather than chasing a big dream.
Hey! Welcome! \xfffeWe have very fresh ingredients!
What do you think of my Pokémon?\xfffeThey are fresh!
Thank you very much!\xfffeHow were mine?
Didn't you come here for\xfffea Pokémon battle?
Don't be scared, or\xfffeyou will never win.
You are a strong Trainer.\xfffePlease forgive me.
Hiya, honey! Welcome!\xfffeHave you decided what you'll have?
Order up! One humiliation\xfffein a Pokémon battle, over easy.
Order up! One glorious victory\xfffein a Pokémon battle, sunny side up.
Meow, meow, it's a battle, meow.\xfffe(That sounds stupid, doesn't it?)
Yeah! Meow! I won, meow!\xfffe(I seriously want to quit this job.)
Meowww... I lost, meowww.\xfffe(Seriously, I am sooo embarrassed.)
My love for Pokémon is stronger than\xfffeanybody else's. Love can do anything.
This victory proves\xfffemy true love for Pokémon.
Love should conquer all. Love should\xfffehelp me win, shouldn't it?
Oh, do you want to see the Pokémon\xfffethat I am proudest of?
What do you think about my \xfffedear Pokémon? Aren't they great?
Oh, my goodness!\xfffeMy poor Pokémon...
For the honor of the branch office!\xfffeHere I go!
I am the branch manager of the Pokéfan.\xfffeI won!
Pfft. Good-bye for now, child!\xfffeI'll remember this!
I lost a lot of things because\xfffeI love Pokémon too much...
I've devoted my life to Pokémon. \xfffeI see things differently than you do.
I cannot win even with my devotion.\xfffeWhat shall I do?!
Listen. I love love love Pokémon.
I will be a Pokémon in my next life.
I love your Pokémon, too!\xfffePlease let me pet them!
I am not good at battling, but\xfffethis is one of the duties of a Pokéfan.
I kept the honor of the Pokéfan.\xfffeHahaha.
Cheers, all you Pokéfans!!\xfffeMay the Pokéfan last forever!
I wanted to go hiking,\xfffebut I took the wrong train.
Well, this place is also interesting.
Ah, mountains... The mountains are\xfffecalling me.
I am no mere Hiker.\xfffeCall me an alpinist.
A mountain maniac like me\xfffeis properly called an alpinist.
A specialist in mountainous matters.\xfffeThat is an alpinist.
I'm a Fisherman, so I have my rod here,\xfffebut this is cumbersome.
I won the battle, but\xfffeI did not need this rod at all.
Ah... This rod is so cumbersome!\xfffeI will quit fishing!
Oh, I kin tell yer rilly sumpthin'.
I knew it. You rilly ARE sumpthin'.
Like always, the big one done got away.
I won't be a Parasol Lady without\xfffea parasol, so I must use it.
I think it is strange to use\xfffea parasol indoors, though.
My parasol... My parasol is broken!\xfffeI will be just a Lady.
My boyfriend left me on a rainy day.\xfffeSo I will take it out on you.
The rain is piercing my broken heart\xfffeand washing it clean.
They say rainy days never stay,\xfffebut will the rain in my heart ever stop?
I've been waiting for someone like you\xfffefor a long, long time.
I know you are the best.\xfffeI will never let you go.
I like you.\xfffePlease be my friend.
I won't go easy on you just because\xfffeyou're a kid. Bring it on!
Heh. You cannot have a battle\xfffeif you are afraid of losing.
Humph. I am still weak.\xfffeI feel sorry for my Pokémon...
I am bad and stupid, but\xfffeI am very serious about Pokémon.
I feel peaceful only when I am with Pokémon.
I hope you will find something\xfffeyou can be serious about.
My shiny bald head is my secret.
The more I shave my head,\xfffethe stronger I can be.
You should have\xfffea shiny bald head to be stronger.
You must be laughing at me 'cause\xfffeI rode this far on my motorbike.
I've decided to live my life on my bike.
I am a coward who cannot even go out\xfffewithout my bike.
I am roaring around on my bike\xfffeand chasing my own dream.
I feel I am getting one step closer\xfffeto my dream.
You have to follow your own dream!
I am a Biker.\xfffeBut I've never ridden a bike.
I am a Biker.\xfffeI don't have any friends yet.
I am a Biker.\xfffeI've never won yet.
My Pokémon are on the rise! I raised\xfffethem with special yeast bread!
You'll get well again if you\xfffeeat my special bread.
You are strong.\xfffeAre you eating my special bread?
One loaf, two loaves... No matter how\xfffemany times I count, one loaf is missing.
One loaf of bread is missing...\xfffeThe master will be angry...
Oh, I'm so resentful...\xfffeWhere is the missing loaf of bread?
Hey, you!\xfffeDo you eat a good breakfast every day?
I never miss breakfast,\xfffeso I am healthy and plump!
The first step for healthy living is\xfffeto eat a good breakfast.
I am not loafing on the job!\xfffeI am on patrol!
This place is dangerous!\xfffeThis is too much fun!
I know about trouble like you!\xfffeI am keeping my eye on you!
I am a Policeman!\xfffeIn other words, I am justice!
Justice always prevails!\xfffeThat is why I won!
I... I am a Policeman!\xfffeWhy did justice fail?
I got scolded by my boss, and I lost\xfffemy motivation. I'll take it out on you!
Hehehe. You see!\xfffeI am brilliant here.
Oh, man! \xfffeAm I useless here, too?
I am young and fresh!\xfffeI am nothing if not young!
What do you think? What do you think?\xfffeI am very strong, aren't I?
I am fine even when I lose a battle.\xfffeI am lively, lively!
I worked my way up to the top of the\xfffecomedians, and now I am a big shot.
You have a good sense of humor.\xfffeDo you want to be my assistant?
Looking at you reminds me of friends\xfffefrom when I was working my way up.
I cannot do impressive stunts,\xfffeso I will perform normally.
I am sorry. I shouldn't have won.\xfffeI am just a Harlequin.
I am a Harlequin, but I'm sorry I cannot\xfffeplay the fool after I lose.
I am smiling, though I am sad at heart.\xfffeThis is the play of a lifetime!
You! That's not in the script!\xfffeYou ruined the play!
Ha ha ha! It is the destiny of a Harlequin\xfffeto smile when he loses.
Oh, no! I came to play\xfffewithout taking off my uniform.
Wow! Seriously? I won!\xfffeI cannot go home when I win.
Ahhhhh! And I lost!\xfffeThis is not my day.
You know, I am very popular,\xfffethanks to this costume.
Being popular is simple...\xfffeI like it that way.
I feel good 'cause I am popular, but\xfffesometimes I feel empty.
Welcome back.\xfffeYou must be tired from your work.
You must be tired.\xfffePlease do rest awhile.
That was superb!\xfffeYou are very strong indeed.
I used to be so popular, but\xfffenow I am all washed up.
I was overwhelmed by success, I took it\xfffefor granted, and I did not work hard.
As times change, values change.\xfffeI realized it too late.
Well, well, you strike impressive poses.\xfffeIf you lose, I hope you'll model for me.
I will do a sketch of you,\xfffefrustrated by failure. Please hold still.
Please wait. I can create a masterpiece\xfffeif you are my model.
Sensitivity is important for battles, too.\xfffeYou! Feel it!
You need to feel it more! More!\xfffeOtherwise you cannot win!
Ahh! I sense it!\xfffeI sense your hypersensitive sensitivity!
Everybody grows bit by bit\xfffeif somebody cherishes them.
I have cherished these Pokémon\xfffesince they were small.
You are also here \xfffebecause someone cherished you.
These days, when children fight,\xfffetheir parents fight on their behalf.
Children of childish parents.\xfffeWhat kind of adults will they become?
Childish fights among adults are\xfffeworse than fights among kids.
Iaaaa! You are cute!\xfffeI want to take you home as my own!
Your face is cute even when you've lost!\xfffeI want to comfort you, little one!
Ooooh! You are really cute!\xfffeI want to raise you as my own!
I'll show you we can break you.\xfffeWe've trained in the field!
How were my Pokémon?\xfffeThey're very powerful, aren't they?
That's strange! I wonder why...\xfffeI shouldn't be outmuscled.
Oh, you look very active!\xfffeWhat say we battle?
OK! It's done!\xfffeHow are my partners?
Goood, you are young!\xfffeMy partners were totally crushed!
Pokémon battles after work\xfffeare the one thing I truly enjoy.
Ahhhhhhhhh!\xfffeThat's why I cannot quit training Pokémon.
Urrrrrrrgh. It hurts.\xfffeIt hurts for a single man like me.
Pokémon are popular at work, too.\xfffeOld guys can enjoy these battles!
Am I good for a guy who just\xfffebattles during his lunch breaks?
Old guys and kids can both enjoy\xfffebattling with Pokémon.
Keep pedaling even when your legs\xfffecrumble. This is the secret of Cyclists.
A Pokémon trained by cycling\xfffecould never lose against a person like you.
My cycling has no limits.\xfffeI will challenge you again someday.
My steel-wheeled friend brought me here.\xfffeIsn't it the greatest ever?
This is my best friend forever!\xfffeAlways reliable and true as steel!
I blundered, stumbled, and lost...\xfffeWell, I still have my one and only.
Fun time is over.\xfffeTime to wake up!
The end always comes as a shock.
You are greatly mistaken if you\xfffethink you can dream forever.
I'm done! It's just not good enough.\xfffeA Bicycle is not enough of a challenge.
A Bicycle cannot satisfy me.\xfffeI will join the Bikers!
Faster!! I want a speed that nobody\xfffecan beat!
I won't surrender to you.\xfffeYou are nothing but a young fellow!
I won't lose against whippersnappers!\xfffeI shall struggle on until the day I die!
Impressive! You are skillful for a\xfffegreen stripling, young fellow!
Like a powerful foaming cleanser,\xfffeI will remove you!
Like a well-polished tile,\xfffethis is a sparkling victory!
Like a worn-out dust rag...
I am doing this job because\xfffeI love love love trains.
You are happy if you choose something\xfffeyou like as a job.
I love trains too much.\xfffeIt's a sickness, really...
Your journey will end here.\xfffeI am your terminal.
I praise you for coming up here.\xfffeBut now, go home!
Ah... I didn't see it coming.\xfffeI will rest over here...
I need to prove I'm worthy.\xfffeI cannot lose against a child.
Am I childish? Adults do\xfffewhatever it takes to win.
My honor, my pride... I cannot show myself\xfffeto my coworkers in such a miserable state.
Hey, I've learned a few things in my time.\xfffeLet me demonstrate!
Not everyone likes me, but\xfffeI am quite the Trainer, aren't I?
Your technique shows wisdom...\xfffeAre you also an old man?
They say a company with lively workers\xfffeis a good company!
I work hard all the time!\xfffeI can battle 24/7!
Oh, look at the time!\xfffeI have to get back to work!
My boss is seriously annoying!\xfffeI believe I'll take it out on you!
Thank you for having a battle with me.\xfffeI feel much better.
You should choose your company carefully,\xfffebecause you cannot choose your boss.
Are you my next patient?\xfffeGet over here!
Good, good. I am glad\xfffethat you and your Pokémon are obedient.
Wait! You, wait!\xfffeThe surgery has not started yet!
When there is a patient, I will be there.\xfffeThat is my job.
Please put yourself at ease!\xfffeYour Doctor is here.
If you are hurt, please call me.\xfffeI'll be there for you.
Please go easy on me.\xfffeI just finished my night shift.
After all that work, let's relax\xfffewith some Pokémon battles!
Yawn... I'm sleepy...\xfffeI can't stay awake any longer...
How are you and your Pokémon?
I will inject you with my energy!
People can do so much\xfffeas long as they have energy!
A Gentleman should have\xfffea liking for battles.
A Gentleman should bask\xfffein the elegant glow of his victory.
A Gentleman should accept the result of\xfffea battle with a stoic mind.
I will evaluate your ability.
Hm... As a Trainer, you are\xfffeat the level of a Preschooler.
Hmm... As a Trainer, you are\xfffeat the level of Pokéfans.
You can learn a lot from mature women,\xfffesuch as wisdom and good manners.
Woohoo! Were you knocked out by\xfffethe Socialite's charm?
Did you enjoy the battle with me?
Oh-ho! Let's have a unique\xfffeand elegant battle.
Ah-ha! I was not confident, \xfffebut this is a delightful surprise.
Eeeeee! I'll remember this!
Obedient Pokémon, selfish Pokémon...\xfffePokémon have unique characteristics.
You should not get angry at your Pokémon,\xfffeeven when you lose.
It is important to nurture and train\xfffeeach Pokémon's characteristics.
Do you discipline your Pokémon?\xfffePampering them too much is no good.
You need to discipline Pokémon you\xfffelove when they are misbehaving.
Too much praise can spoil\xfffeboth Pokémon and people.
Pokémon never betray you.\xfffeThey will return the love you give them.
This proves my love has been received\xfffeby my Pokémon.
It's about time for me to give someone\xfffemy affection, though.
Shall I give you a tip for\xfffetraining good Pokémon?
The tip for training good Pokémon is\xfffeto catch good Pokémon.
You don't seem to need any tips\xfffefor training good Pokémon.
Glad you made it! It won't be\xfffean easy job from here.
Haha! You see!?\xfffeYou are not ready yet.
Earlier I got a little carried away,\xfffebut what job was I talking about?
Both my mom and dad are Ace Trainers.\xfffeSo I am an Ace, too!
I want to be an Ace Trainer like\xfffemy mom and dad.
Waaaa! I should have superior genes and\xfffebe able to ride on my parents' coattails...
I don't mind your lack of focus, but you\xfffewill get no sympathy from me if you lose.
Ah, you see! You did not focus\xfffeon the battle. That's why you lost.
That is quite enough. It's over.\xfffeDon't stare at me!
Dad... Mom...\xfffeI'll have a battle. Look...
Dad... Mom...\xfffeDid you see me? I won... I won!
Dad... Mom...\xfffeWhat shall I do?
I came here to goof off.\xfffeI don't want to cram for the big test...
I cannot lose...\xfffeI don't want to study anymore.
No! I don't want to go home!\xfffeI don't want to study!
I just want to be successful\xfffeand grow rich someday.
My dream is simply to be rich.
I will be rich someday and\xfffeput you to shame.
I don't care who you are\xfffeor where you come from.
How should we act?\xfffeThat is all that matters, isn't it?
A label is not important, is it?\xfffeAfter all, you are you, aren't you?
Pokémon battles and study sessions\xfffeare much the same. Let's be efficient!
You are too inefficient.\xfffeYou need to be more quick and responsive.
How did I lose against such a slacker?\xfffeI cannot believe it!
I have money to burn,\xfffeso I don't want anything.
The only thing I enjoy\xfffeis a Pokémon battle...
Just because I am rich\xfffedoes not mean I am especially happy.
Yes! I am a Rich Boy!
Well, good-bye!\xfffeYou have been beaten by a Rich Boy!
Thank you! Merci!\xfffeYou defeated a Rich Boy!
I just battle for fun,\xfffebut I'll do my best.
Well, I only won by chance.\xfffePlease pay it no mind.
It's good when you battle for fun.\xfffeIf it's too serious, you won't enjoy it...
Yesterday was a party. Today is a\xfffebattle. I am rich. I always have fun!
I do not have to work,\xfffebecause I am loaded with cash.
All play makes me a dull girl.\xfffeDo you think I don't know that?
I'm proud of these Pokémon!\xfffeGo on, rush the enemy position!
My Pokémon are mighty!\xfffeI will carve my name in history!
I won't cry... I won't.\xfffeSomeday, I will be able to win.
I came here for my big brother\xfffewho always hides in his room.
My big brother the hermit,\xfffeI won for you! Come out and play!
I wish my brother would\xfffecome out of his room and play with me...
Hello me old china,\xfffetime for the rhyma!
Bit of a Pokémon read and write,\xfffeTrainer, many clinks!
Even if you dipper, you'll be fine.\xfffeBest of friar, Trainer!
All Dad and Mom do is mumble\xfffeat their computers! That's no fun!
I don't like Dad, or Mom, or computers!\xfffeAll I need are my Pokémon!
Instead of mumbling to computers,\xfffeI wish they would talk to me...
A globe-trotting young adventurer.\xfffeThat's me!
Seeing Pokémon all over the world is\xfffethe purpose of my journey.
Adventure is calling me.\xfffeFarewell! See you again!
Let's take it easy\xfffewith Pokémon and with life.
It's OK to bust your tail. But you need\xfffeto have some breathing room.
No problem. No problem.\xfffeI will have another chance.
I've traveled 3,000 miles searching\xfffefor a husband! A journey to nowhere.
Please let me know if there is a rich,\xfffewealthy, or affluent gentleman!
My goal is a wedding band...\xfffeBut is that really a utopia?
A game is life,\xfffebut life is not a game.
I am always serious. You cannot win\xfffeif you think this is just a game.
I'll give up games forever and set out\xfffeon a journey... Just kidding!
I'll always work part-time, because\xfffeit lets me focus on what I really love.
You have only one life to live.\xfffeAre you doing what you want to do?
I want to play here forever\xfffewithout being tied down.
I took this job 'cause I wanted to see\xfffesmiles on people's faces.
Don't look at me like that.\xfffeSmile! Smile!
It's very frustrating,\xfffebut I am glad I saw you smile.
Let's start a battle already!\xfffeWe are wasting time.
What? Is it already over?\xfffeWe still have lots of time.
We ran out of time.\xfffeWe cannot go into overtime!
I am battling here to promote\xfffethe café where I work.
You are not that strong,\xfffeso you are not really right for my café.
Yowza! What a strong Trainer!\xfffeSee you at my café next time, OK?
Join the Pokéfans.\xfffeYour life will be happy!
If you join the Pokéfans,\xfffeyou'll be strong like me!
If you join the Pokéfans,\xfffeyour life will be saved!
I am not a regular Pokéfan.\xfffeI am a major mega-Pokéfan!
I love Pokémon.\xfffeI love love Pokémon!
You'll remember this!\xfffeI am a big Pokéfan!
I think I am a Pokéfan,\xfffetherefore I am a Pokéfan.
The Pokéfan is power.
You should remember this.\xfffeI am a Pokéfan.
There are young and beautiful people,\xfffebut youth is different from beauty.
If I had known that when I was young,\xfffeI would not have a hard time now...
Youth is just youth.\xfffeI wish I had realized it back then.
Ho there! You are a mountain standing\xfffein my way, aren't ya?
Yahoooooo!! Yahoooooooo!\xfffeHear my cry of triumph!
Grrr... My victory has disappeared\xfffein a crevasse...
Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!\xfffeI am a Hiker. I have a cult following!
Oh no? It's over already?\xfffeHiker is bored!!
This is important, so remember this!\xfffeDon't judge a book by its cover!
Despite my appearance, I am the head\xfffeof a certain outfit. Don't tell anyone.
Don't tell anyone that I am playing here.
The boss does not have freedom.\xfffeI feel like a captured Pokémon.
The truth is, I want to have a quiet life\xfffefishing all day, every day.
Ah... I don't want to do anything but fish.\xfffeI am tired of winning and losing.
At my time of life, it doesn't matter\xfffeif I win or lose.
Hello? Me? What, now?\xfffeI am about to have a battle.
Hello? Can you hear me?\xfffeI just won the battle.
Ah... Hello? Can you hear me?\xfffeArgh! I lost...
He told me that I was like a squall,\xfffebut what is a squall?
W-wah! Wahhh!\xfffeI am so happy that I am crying.
W-w-wahhhhh! Wahhhhh!\xfffeWahhhhh! Wahhhhh!
No need to chat with someone\xfffeI'm about to battle.
Life is over if you lose.\xfffeThat's why I hold out.
Don't look at miserable me!\xfffeGo away!
You have your way.\xfffeI have my way.
I will go my way 'cause\xfffeI don't have any other way.
Your way must be rocky.\xfffeGood luck. I am behind you all the way.
Hey, you! Don't mess with me,\xfffeor I will destroy your Pokémon!
Thought you might make trouble for me,\xfffebut what a wimpy attack!
How could I lose to such a wimpy move?\xfffeGah, that bugs the snot out of me!
My dad and mom are both Veterans,\xfffebut I am a loser...
I wonder if my mom and dad will be sad\xfffeif they see that I've become a Roughneck.
I cannot be like my mom and dad.\xfffeSo I will live as a Roughneck.
My partner has turned to dust,\xfffebut his Pokémon is my Pokémon now.
Are you watching me, my long-lost partner?\xfffeThat Pokémon of yours, we get along...
He was trash, but now he is eternal,\xfffelike the stars in the sky... Ah, my partner!
I am no good at speaking...\xfffeSo my bike speaks...
Zooooom! Zoom whoosh!\xfffeZooooom! Zoom zam!
Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!\xfffeVrooooooooom! Vroom!
All right! Are you ready?\xfffeDon't mess with a Biker!
I'm a Biker, so I'm more obsessed\xfffewith speed than anyone else!!
The truth is we are good guys.\xfffeWe cannot do bad things at all!
Like uncooked dough,\xfffemy Pokémon are sticky!
Now you're stuck, aren't ya?
Well, your Pokémon are quite springy, too.
As I bake bread, I will bake your\xfffePokémon, too.
Oh my... Your Pokémon are like\xfffeburned bread.
Ah, how frustrating and disappointing!\xfffeYou burned me with that last move...
Just as I knead the dough,\xfffeI'll knead you into shape.
Wanna be kneaded a little more?\xfffeOr shall I sandwich you with bread?
Ooooo! I'll remember this!\xfffeI'll turn you into a sandwich someday!
Laughing makes people feel better.\xfffeThere seems to be scientific proof!
Haaa ha ha! Ha?\xfffeWhat's wrong? Let's laugh!
Laugh at miserable me--I lost against\xfffeamazing you. Laugh and you'll feel better.
You think you can win against me?\xfffeIt might not go as smoothly as you think.
Don't underestimate me just because\xfffeI am a Harlequin.
No. This can't be happening.\xfffeYou're not an ordinary person.
Observe my beautiful Pokémon magic!\xfffePlease watch closely!
I know a few gimmicks and tricks,\xfffe'cause this is magic.
Tricks and magic are my bread and butter.\xfffeAny Harlequin knows their worth!
Tedious talk is unnecessary...\xfffeI will just break you...
What? Are you broken already?
Ugh, I'm broken...
I have low self-esteem,\xfffeso I like someone to give me orders.
You are not my boss, so\xfffeit doesn't matter even if you are weak.
Can I call you my boss?
This outfit is not a uniform,\xfffeit's what I like to wear. I made it myself.
This is a uniform from an anime.\xfffeDoesn't it look good on me?
I want to live in a world of games,\xfffeanime, and comics forever.
I'm not cut out for a regular job,\xfffeso I live on art.
I envy Pokémon, 'cause they are\xfffecarefree. I want to be a Pokémon.
Bah, if I can do a regular job,\xfffeI will quit doing this stinking art.
Every time a Pokémon uses a move,\xfffemy heart will tremble!
Nothing stirs the soul\xfffemore than Pokémon moves.
Aha! Pokémon moves are so beautiful!\xfffeI could almost faint!
I will make you cry,\xfffe'cause you just don't know when to quit.
A state of deep sorrow and confusion\xfffecan also be art.
Someday, you will appreciate the value\xfffeof defeat and sorrow.
Our job is hard,\xfffe'cause it's such physical work.
My work gave me these great muscles.
Don't underestimate the power of kids.\xfffeLike I did with you!
Raising Pokémon and raising kids.\xfffeBoth are very hard.
When my Pokémon do well like this,\xfffeI forget my everyday troubles.
Even I raise them with tender care,\xfffebecause I am their Trainer...
Hey, you!\xfffeI promise I will take it easy on you!
Heheh... I will take it easy on you. Heh.
Sometimes even grown-ups want\xfffesomeone to take care of them.
The job site is quite dangerous, but\xfffeI'll have to keep working with Pokémon.
I have trained my Pokémon well,\xfffeand it's ready to go to the job site.
Ugh. I cannot make money tomorrow\xfffe'cause I am injured.
Welcome!
Only the winner!\xfffeOnly the winner can celebrate.
Enough... That's enough...
I do menial work every single day.\xfffeAm I just a cog in the machine?
I am well broken in. No snags slow down\xfffethe smooth running of this machine!
I may be happier than a person who\xfffecannot even be a cog in the machine.
Yo, kid! Are you new? I'm the Worker\xfffethat everybody is talking about.
If you don't know me, you're bogus!\xfffeGood-bye! The Worker is heading out.
Kid! Remember me! I am the Worker\xfffeeverybody's talking about.
Well, let me introduce myself.\xfffeThese are my little darlings.
How was it? My little darlings are tough and\xfffecute, aren't they?
Phew! Your little darlings are awesome, too!
Whir, whir, whir, whoooosh!
Ring-ring! Ding-ding!
Bam!
This is the very latest model,\xfffea limited-edition, carbon-fiber Bicycle.
When you have good tools,\xfffeyou feel better about yourself.
Don't! Please don't touch my Bicycle.\xfffeYou'll cover it with your filthy fingerprints.
Speed is the key in a battle!\xfffeDash! Dash! Dash!
If I compare how I'm feeling right now to a\xffferace, it is just like crossing the finish line!
I cannot take your nonsense anymore!\xfffeI am moving back to my mother's place.
Hey, you! Take out all the Pokémon\xfffeyou have here!
Huh? That's all you have?\xfffeAren't you hiding a few more Pokémon?
I see. There seems to be nothing\xfffesuspicious about you or your Pokémon.
I'll protect my peace by myself.
My peace remains protected.
Please don't disturb my peace and quiet.
I was born to work.\xfffeThat is my destiny.
I will work, work, and work some more.\xfffeI am happy only when I am working.
As a matter of fact, having battles\xfffeis my job, too.
I'm-a lowest rank now, but\xfffeI'm-a gonna be at the top someday!
I'm-a gonna be the brightest star\xfffein the business! Top of the world, ma!
You work it like a shining star!\xfffeI'm not gonna lose, I'm not gonna lose!
I have an ambition!\xfffeI will take over the company!
All this serves my ambition!\xfffeIt brings my sweet victory one step closer!
I was obsessed with the golden prize,\xfffewith my glittering ambition!
I am treated as an idol at the office.\xfffeEverybody pampers me.
Everybody works for me,\xfffeso I have nothing to do.
The truth is I don't like brushing my teeth\xfffeor taking a bath, but don't tell anyone.
You look dusty.\xfffeI'll give you a good scrub!
OK, you look a little bit cleaner now!
Hey! Don't run away!\xfffeYou need to be scrubbed more!
These fruits of stubbornness were raised\xfffestubbornly by a stubborn old man.
This stubborn old man raised them.\xfffeMy persistence is different from yours!
There's a fine line between persistence\xfffeand stubbornness. I may retire soon.
I'm good at driving, but\xfffeI'm not good at dealing with Pokémon.
Oh, it went unexpectedly well.\xfffeBy any chance, am I a technician?
My train does what I need. It's harder to\xfffeconvince living Pokémon to do things my way.
I've never left this place even once\xfffesince I was born.
I wonder if I will live here\xfffefor the rest of my life...
I wonder how long I will stay here...\xfffeWhat is there outside this world?
I say this as a Doctor.\xfffeFirst of all, you must save money.
Money cannot buy health.\xfffeBut you cannot stay healthy if you're poor.
Because without money, you can neither\xfffeeat healthy food nor go to see a Doctor.
As you can see, I am a Doctor,\xfffebut I've never examined a patient.
I've studied to become a Doctor,\xfffebut I faint when I see blood.
I am a Sunday Doctor,\xffferather like a Sunday driver.
Can you understand\xfffewhat medical personnel need?
What a Doctor needs is love--\xfffethe rush of unconditional love.
Medical service is love.\xfffeCan you be a Doctor?
I took this job because I wanted\xfffeto be needed by someone.
My job is hard,\xfffebut I am happy to help people.
When a patient leaves the hospital,\xfffeI feel happy but a bit sad.
Grown-ups have a lot of hobbies.\xfffeActually, I am a uniform collector.
I am not a Nurse.\xfffeI wear this uniform just for fun.
You realized that I am a fake Nurse!\xfffeYes, I am just a uniform collector.
Even if you are injured, I will treat you.\xfffeSo let's fight hard.
Sorry! I went too far. Do you require\xfffeimmediate hospitalization?
You went too far! I will bill you\xfffethe cost of my medical expenses!
I raised these very special Pokémon\xfffeusing a special method.
Pokémon will be strong or weak\xfffedepending on how you raise them.
Ugh... It wasn't supposed to be like this.\xfffeDid I blend the essence wrong?
Shall I share an exclusive tip\xfffefor training great Pokémon?
You'll be perfect if you buy my book\xfffeof Pokémon training tips.
You'll be fine if you buy my DVD\xfffeof Pokémon training tips.
Pokémon are my family!\xfffeSee the solidarity of my family!
Well done, brothers and sisters!\xfffeOur family solidarity is invincible!
NO! My family!\xfffeWhat have you done?!
What you like and what you're good at\xfffeare different, or at least separate.
I am good at battling,\xfffebut I don't enjoy it very much.
If you like what you do as a job,\xfffeyou have a sense of fulfillment, don't you?
In summary, you cannot win against me.
You see, you cannot win, because\xfffeyou are very weak.
Hummmm... You are good.\xfffeYou are really pretty good.
Don't underestimate me because I'm old.\xfffeI'll show you my rejuvenating attack!
I'm old but still going strong!\xfffeI can take care of myself!
What a cruel way to treat a helpless\xfffeold man! Shame on you!
I would like to retire soon. But I have\xfffeno one to carry on the family tradition...
If I had a child like you,\xfffemy golden years would be carefree...
I wish my son were\xfffeas mature as you are.
I feel sad when I see a young and\xfffebright child like you.
The first flush of youth...\xfffeYou are too bright for me...
Sparkling eyes, firm skin...\xfffeI won't get them back.
Hey! It's me. It's me!\xfffeI am the best Pilot in the world!
How's that? Pwned!!
You! Who are you?!\xfffeDo you know who I am?
I'm at the top of the heap! I'm a man\xfffewho always wants to come in first.
Remember this! My favorite words\xfffeare "top of the heap."
You. Well done!\xfffeSee you! I'll remember this!
I won't back down, lose, or fail!\xfffeNo defeat for a Clerk ⑭.
Uh-huh!
Uuugh... Well done...\xfffeYou made me fall to my knees...
I can do it! I can do anything!\xfffeI will do it! I will do it!
Yes! I did it! I can do it!\xfffeI can do it! I can doooooooo it!
But I listened to my Teacher's advice.\xfffeI can't lose! I can't!
My research will lead this world\xfffeto peace and happiness.
I am a genius. I will control\xfffethe future of the world!
I am a genius... I am not supposed\xfffeto lose against someone like you...
Only research is left in my life.\xfffeI abandoned my family and friends.
It's not bad to devote my whole life\xfffeto research, is it?
Dedicating yourself to something\xfffecan cause loneliness.
Hyuck-yuck-yuck... Please lend me\xfffea hand for my experiment.
Hyuck-yuck-yuck... I did it.\xfffeThe experiment was a huge success.
Ho-hum. This is not good...\xfffeThis experiment was a failure...
You must face off against\xfffemy extremely powered-up Pokémon!
Well, this is a natural outcome.\xfffeThe power of science is awesome.
Your Pokémon have even more awesome\xfffestrength than the power of science.
If you lose, I'll have you help me\xfffein my latest experiment!
Ho hi ho. You lost! You will help science\xfffeas my new assistant.
Pah. I was sooo close to signing you up\xfffeas my new assistant.
Why do people compete and fight?\xfffeThis is the subject of my research.
Even if you win, you will hurt your\xfffeopponent's feelings.
If you lose, you may resent your opponent.
Hi! Focus!
Foooooooooooo!
Eeek!
Speech can be utter nonsense.\xfffePretty words only taint battles...
Trainers who treat battles as a sport\xfffeare the height of vileness...
Defeat is worth nothing.\xfffeLosers don't need words...
He-he-he. If you lose,\xfffeI will turn you into a Pokémon.
He-he-he. Well, from today on,\xfffeyou are already a Pokémon.
Next time I see you, I will turn you\xfffeinto a Pokémon with my power.
Argh... I have a headache...\xfffeI have such a headache...
I don't need psychic powers.\xfffePlease stop this headache...
If I don't keep using my power for battles,\xfffemy headache won't go away...
I claim that I am a Psychic,\xfffebut I cannot use psychic powers.
I am camouflaging it\xfffewith my Psychic-ish costume.
I go to magic classes\xfffeto look like a Psychic.
...Grrr... Yeeek!!\xfffeAn evil spirit! Go away!!
OK! The evil spirit\xfffethat possessed you has disappeared.
Evil spirit!\xfffeLeave the Trainer at once!
I praise your courage for challenging me!\xfffeI am the one with the strongest kick.
Haha... I probably did not have to use\xfffemy strongest kick on you.
Oh... The Pokémon did the fighting.\xfffeMy strong kick didn't help a bit.
'Suuup! I'll give it all I've got!\xfffeLet's do our best!!
'Sup! That's enough!\xfffePlease value your life!
'Suuuuup! Good work. I tried everything\xfffeI could, but I'm disappointed.
Yo!
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Yo!
You don't have to impress me.\xfffeYou can lose against me.
Come. Sleep quietly in my arms...
It's sad to say good-bye,\xfffebut we're running out of time.
Are you ready?\xfffeI'll take the gloves off.
Well, well... You're not even in my league.\xfffeThis is like bullying.
Aww... I cannot believe I lost!\xfffeWho are you?!
I would like to do the fighting\xfffeinstead of my Pokémon if I could.
Pokémon battles are not enough of a\xfffechallenge. I want to make this personal.
Ah, I tingle with excitement.\xfffeI would like to fight...
Halt at once! You over there!\xfffeLet us cross lances!
Trainer, you are at my mercy!
Trainer, I yield! \xfffePlease spare me. Please!
When I am surrounded by nature,\xfffemost other things cease to matter.
I won. But victory is nothing,\xfffecompared to the vastness of nature...
It doesn't matter to the vastness\xfffeof nature whether I win or lose...
Despite my appearance, I am a city boy.\xfffeSo I yearn for country life.
Do you have a hometown?\xfffeIf so, you should go back and visit there.
I don't have a hometown to go back to,\xfffe'cause I was born and raised in the city.
It's my mission to protect nature\xfffeand all Pokémon living there!
If villains disturb the natural order,\xfffeI will put them all in jail!
Protect Mother Nature!\xfffeOtherwise, I will put you in jail!
We need a lot of money to protect\xfffeMother Nature and her Pokémon.
Please donate money for a rich natural\xfffeenvironment and for the Pokémon.
We protect forests and Pokémon by\xfffesaving money and planting trees.
Let me stop your winning streak here.
Ah. You still have much to learn.\xfffeLet me give you a crash course!
You didn't win alone. You couldn't have won\xfffewithout your Pokémon.
You seem to be quite confident.\xfffeI'll sink you straight away.
I am devoting my body and soul\xfffeto Pokémon battles!
AAAAAAAAH! I am sooooo scared!\xfffeI will never do it again... Sorrrry!
I'm working very hard, but\xfffethat doesn't mean I am strong.
You're a strong Trainer,\xfffeso I think I was just lucky this time.
Even I can lose?!\xfffeBut I'm a battling genius!
I started battling just to be cool, but\xfffeI became an Ace before I knew it.
People can become strong if they have\xfffeclear goals. That's the way it goes.
I'm still not popular even though\xfffeI've been recognized as an Ace.
The lead character of this story...\xfffeI'll tell you who it is!
The lead character of the story is me!\xfffeYou are just an extra!
Of course, you are the lead character!
We would like to hold a Pokémon battle\xfffeagainst the strongest foe.
We cannot believe we spent time\xfffeon such a childish battle! Leave at once!
Ho-ho-ho! That is to our liking!\xfffeWe find ourselves quite satisfied!
A person who wants to fight, fight, and\xfffefight forever. That's the way of the Ace.
However hard they battle, they won't be\xfffesatisfied. That is a real Trainer, isn't it?
Your fighting style suits you very well.\xfffeYou can be an Ace Trainer.
I can see despair in your eyes.\xfffeBring it on!
It was a waste of time, much as I suspected.\xfffeYou should start training all over again.
Did I underestimate you as just a little kid?\xfffeOr was this your true ability?
Hey, you, young Trainer.\xfffeI am utterly stylish, aren't I?
I am so stylish,\xfffeI hypnotize myself! Step back!
I'm a wreck. I'm adrift. It just kills me.\xfffeIt is hard to be too stylish.
I won't lose against a kid like you,\xfffewho doesn't know anything about battles.
After all, you are an amateur. No sweat.\xfffe(Whew... That was a little too close!)
What? This kid is a fast learner?\xfffeHa ha ha... I had no idea!
Argh. Cough, cough. I don't feel well.\xfffePlease show a little kindness.
I lied when I said I didn't feel well!\xfffeVeterans do anything to win!
You're very sharp!\xfffeYou did not fall for my illness act.
I will give you a taste\xfffeof a Veteran's well-trained Pokémon.
How were the Veteran's Pokémon?\xfffeDefeat is bitter, isn't it?
You have served me a spicy defeat.\xfffeAnd yet defeat is also part of life.
Oh, you are so cute!\xfffeCome, I promise to be nice in this battle.
You are so cute, really...\xfffeI want to see you again. I'll be waiting.
Your battle is a little too cute.\xfffeLet's play again sometime.
Oh, you are still a child.\xfffeWho said you could come here?
You're not bad, but you're immature.\xfffeCome back when you've learned something.
I thought you were a child.\xfffeHee hee... You are tough...
Don't call me a Veteran!\xfffeA woman's mind is always blooming.
I'm not finished with love or Pokémon.\xfffeI'll stay fit and ready all my life.
I have pains in my eyes, my shoulder, and\xfffemy back, but my heart is forever young.
I am the strongest Backpacker.\xfffeI have a lot of Pokémon in my Bag.
Hahaha! I am as big as my backpack,\xfffearen't I? Aren't I?
I have more Pokémon in my Bag!\xfffeWait, my Bag has a hole...
I am not traveling for freedom.
You're carrying bulky luggage,\xfffebut do you really need it?
My Bag is as wide as the sky.\xfffeIn other words, my Bag is empty.
I haven't eaten anything for days.\xfffeSpots are floating before my eyes...
Those aren't spots floating before my eyes.\xfffeThose are glorious glimmers of victory!
Ah, I'm sinking fast. All I can think about\xfffeis where my next meal is coming from...
Neither my husband nor I have money,\xfffeso we are hitchhiking on our honeymoon.
Newly married, and such a big trip...\xfffeI'm worried about our future.
On top of that, I have lost track of him...\xfffeWhere can he be wandering?
Hey! Hey! \xfffePlease check out my cute Pokémon!
How about that?\xfffeI'm proud of these Pokémon.
Oh no, don't bother them like that!\xfffePlease leave my Pokémon alone.
Being a Waiter is my disguise,\xfffeand it helps me live quietly.
On my days off, the real me is ready.\xfffeI'm an Ace Trainer!
I'm struggling to make a living,\xfffeso I've been in disguise a long time.
My Pokémon are the strongest.\xfffeI don't think I will lose.
Do you think you can win against me\xfffewith such wimpy Pokémon?
Ah... It's hard.\xfffeIt sure is frustrating to lose.
Don't you think a restaurant\xfffefor Pokémon is a fun idea?
I wonder if people will like\xfffea full-course meal for Pokémon.
It's a restaurant for Pokémon,\xfffenot a restaurant of Pokémon!
Harrumph! Haroooo!
Harooo!
Harrumph!!
I am the mountain range of your life!\xfffeCross me if you can!
Haha! I am the summit, and the road\xfffeto reach me is still very steep!
Finally, someone has climbed the mountain!\xfffeThis is my summit!
If I lose, I'll spill the secret of fishing.\xfffeIf I win, I'll tell you the essence.
The essence of fishing is to pull\xfffeand reel in the fish--nothing else.
The secret of fishing is to wait without\xfffethinking, as if you were dozing off.
I always aim for a big fish!\xfffeStay out of this if you are a small fish!
Reeling you in was hard work.\xfffeYou put up a good fight!
Oh! What a great hit!\xfffeBoth my arms and heart are electrified!
You look kind of mature.\xfffeI like people like you.
Still, you look mature for your age.\xfffeAre you already an adult, or are you a kid?
A man with the heart of a boy\xfffeis just a wheedling child.
How much did this parasol cost?\xfffeWhy, it is a cheap disposable.
I am a Parasol Lady, but I cannot\xfffespend money for a parasol.
A parasol is just a tool. It's fine\xfffeas long as it protects me from the rain.
I can really cut loose in Pokémon\xfffebattles without being scolded.
Nobody scolds me. That's why\xfffePokémon battles are the best!
You like a big fight, don't ya?\xfffeYou are my pal.
My computer friends said I wouldn't be\xfffetaken lightly with this look.
I won, but I was so scared...\xfffeMaybe I am not cut out for this.
Eeek... I should have played\xfffewith my computer in my room.
My ride and I\xfffeare always together.
My ride helps me show off who I am.
My motorbike makes me feel better\xfffewhen I lose.
I don't have money to buy gas,\xfffeso I have to push it with my feet.
I'm one of the Bikers,\xfffeso my bike is crucial.
Ah... Dad, Mom.\xfffeIt's hard to be a Biker...
Aah, I am so hungry that I am\xfffecompletely wiped out. What shall I do?
I'm working at a bakery, 'cause I want to\xfffeeat bread anytime I want.
Aah! I crashed from my sugar high!\xfffeSomeone give me a pastry!
OK, I will do it! \xfffeI am excited about this!
Blast!
I'll remember this!
I'll confuse you with my smooth moves.\xfffeA-one, a-two, cha cha cha!
You could not focus on the battle,\xfffe'cause you were watching my smooth steps!
And one, and two, and twirl, and...\xfffeAh, that didn't work at all! 
Sorry to keep you waiting.\xfffeYour idol, Harlequin, Harlequin.
Thank you very much.\xfffeIt was Harlequin, Harlequin.
It was Harlequin, Harlequin.\xfffeThank you for your support.
If you lose, you can be my servant.
From now on, I am your employer.
I'll make you my servant someday.
Ahhhh... So strange.\xfffeI feel very, very tired.
I still feel kind of blah.\xfffeI'm all achy...
I really feel blah.\xfffeWell, I will go home now.
A child like you cannot understand\xfffethe beauty that I am pursuing.
I am a servant of beauty.\xfffeUgly defeat does not suit me.
Perhaps the beauty I've been looking for...\xfffeis you?
I paint pictures and live with Pokémon.\xfffeI am enjoying my life!
The sting of defeat will be a good\xfffememory as you grow older.
Experience hardships when you are young,\xfffe'cause old bodies cannot take them.
My schoolkids are sleeping.\xfffeI'm shooting for the top during nap time!
Oh, no!\xfffeLook at the time!
After nap time comes snack time.\xfffeI have to go back to preschool soon.
Life is full of so many farewells,\xfffeso I will enjoy the present.
I cannot see you again,\xfffeso I will do my best.
This is a woman's life.\xfffeCan a baby like you understand it?
If you work diligently,\xfffeyou will get results.
You, keep trying.\xfffeMaster the basics.
Well, even if you work diligently,\xfffethings don't always go well.
I've arrived from a distant island.\xfffeMay I please trouble you for a battle?
I have won.
I was utterly inexperienced. I'd be \xfffegrateful if I could be your pupil.
I am so obsessed with Pokémon\xfffethat my wife is as mad as a hornet.
Pokémon battles are so much fun.\xfffeNo way I can quit.
I don't want to go home, 'cause my wife\xfffeis as scary as a legendary Pokémon.
Our lives have plenty of ordinary days.\xfffeI gotta have Pokémon!
Only Pokémon rescue me\xfffefrom boring and monotonous days.
When I look at a special person like you,\xfffeI just melt.
I used to be like you.\xfffeI was full of hopes and dreams.
Dreams are important.\xfffeBut if all you have is your dreamworld...
Just having hopes and dreams is not enough.\xfffeWhat is important is... Never mind.
I want to have an exhilarating battle.\xfffeGot it?
Thank you!\xfffeA battle is extremely exhilarating!
OK, OK, I got it...\xfffeLet's call it a day.
It's OK if I have training wheels.\xfffeIt's OK if my Bike doesn't accelerate.
It's OK if you go your own way.\xfffeYou'll reach your goal someday.
It's OK if you lose.\xfffeIt's OK, 'cause you have a Bicycle.
You ain't never even gonna see\xfffemy Pokémon's moves.
You're slow, ain't ya?
You're right quick! \xfffeWho are ya, anyways?
I just got married, and we'll be\xfffeexpanding our family soon.
You know what I need.\xfffeCan you spare a few dollars?
Oh, I should really get home,\xfffebut Pokémon battles are so much fun...
Take a good look\xfffeat this Clerk ⑭'s sheer strength!
You got me!\xfffeYou have the best skills in the world!
I put on a smile when I'm crying inside.\xfffeThat's a Clerk ⑭'s sad smile.
I will show you the harsh side\xfffeof Pokémon battles.
That's not good.\xfffeI was too generous today.
Did you burn the image of my Pokémon\xfffeinto your mind?
Who do you think I am?\xfffeI am a mighty Policeman!
That's for disobeying me!\xfffeI am a big guy!
You won a battle against a Policeman...\xfffeI will arrest you someday.
It's embarrassing, but I wasn't\xfffewell behaved when I was young.
You lack energy despite your youth.\xfffeShall I train you?
Good, good. Misbehave while you're still\xfffeyoung and you can get away with it.
Squeak! Squeak, squeak, squeak...\xfffeHm? What? Wanna fight?
You're so impatient.\xfffeI'm still in the middle of my work.
Ohh dear... You tracked dirt\xfffeon the floor I just finished cleaning...
There are only two roads in life.\xfffeThe one you like, and the one you hate.
I'll choose the road I like,\xfffeeven though it is not the quickest route.
Actually, the road you hate\xfffemay be the shortcut to your goal.
I am a train.\xfffeI will just run on the tracks.
You are a station where I don't stop.\xfffeI will just pass you by.
I think the train is great, because it runs\xfffethe same route over and over.
You're good at your job\xfffeand very strong.
I expected too much from you.\xfffeYou are lucky that this is not business.
A person who can juggle\xfffework and play is pretty cool.
I've been with these Pokémon\xfffesince I was a child.
Pokémon are like family to me.
I don't think I want to have children.\xfffeI'd rather focus on my Pokémon family.
Hi, I am a physician!\xfffeHey! Let me give you a shot!
Come now, let me give you a shot!\xfffeDon't worry. It won't hurt!
You have strong arms!\xfffeSo let me give you a shot now!
Cough! Cough, cough! How many\xfffemore people will I be able to save?
Cough! I wanted to save more people.\xfffeCough, cough!
Few physicians live well...\xfffeCough! I can't go on any longer...
Do you want a shot?\xfffeOr an IV drip?
You want both a shot and an IV.\xfffeYou are greedy!
Argh. It's sickening!\xfffeYou're such a drip.
In this job,\xfffeI've seen a lot of strange things.
I don't know why, but Ghost-type \xfffePokémon seem attracted to me.
Ahhh, I lost... By the way,\xfffewho is that standing behind you?
I have raised them too long.\xfffeThey are beyond my control...
It's over...\xfffeNobody can stop them...
Finally, they calmed down...\xfffeYou saved me. Thank you!
I will test the Pokémon\xfffeyou have been training.
Bah! Is that the best you can do?\xfffeI expected more from you...
Wow! You are awesome!\xfffeWhat great Pokémon you've trained!
Take a look at these Pokémon--I raised\xfffe'em myself. They make me right proud.
I am right proud of these Pokémon.\xfffeThey're my friends and my treasures.
You are a strong one, sure enuff.\xfffeBut I don't intend to lose next time!
I am the top Breeder.\xfffeI can tame any kind of Pokémon.
You see? My Pokémon are very loyal, \xfffearen't they?
They are too attached to me.\xfffeThey are not fit for battling.
Arghhhh! Who is gentle?!\xfffeI will bring you down!
Arghh! Arghh! \xfffeI am NOT a Gentleman!
Arghh! You! You'll regret this!\xfffeI will bring you down someday!
My brother told me once...\xfffeEyes! Aim for the eyes!
What my brother told me was right...\xfffeThanks... Bro...
I lost against a kid. Bro...\xfffeI should have listened to you...
I can't drop my luxurious lifestyle just\xfffebecause I'm older. Nothing can stop it.
It may be a hard truth for a child,\xfffebut money makes the world go round.
I cannot drop the habits\xfffeI learned when I was young.
I am a late bloomer and a crazy bloomer.\xfffeI'll bloom and dazzle you!
Dance, bloom, and blossom!\xfffeA woman who flowers and triumphs!
I want to blossom and fall\xffferather than dying on the vine.
Hey, it's me. It's me!\xfffeI am the best Pilot in the world!
No! That's no good!\xfffeYou cannot reach the top that way.
Good. You're daring!\xfffeI'll let you come fly on my plane.
Hey! Yo! It's me.\xfffeI am the best Pilot in the world.
Listen! A Trainer should be No. 1.\xfffeThat's it!
You're quite a Trainer!\xfffeBe my apprentice!
