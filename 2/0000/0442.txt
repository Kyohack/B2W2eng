Their colouring changes according to the seasons and can be slightly affected by the temperature and humidity as well.
They migrate according to the seasons, so some people call Sawsbuck the harbingers of spring.
It glides on its outstretched membrane while shocking foes with the electricty stored in the pounches on its cheeks.
For some reason they evolve when they receive electrical energy while they are attacking Shelmet.
Wearing the shell covering they stole from Shelmet, they defend themselves and attack with two lances.
It lures Pokémon with its pattern that looks just like a Poké Ball then releases poison spores.
It moves the caps on both arms and does a dance to lure prey. It prefers damp places.
If its veil-like arms stun and wrap a foe, that foe will be dragged miles below the surface, never to return.
Its body is mostly seawater. It's said there's a castle of ships Jellicent have sunk on the seafloor.
It gently holds injured and weak Pokémon in its fins. Its special membrane heals their wounds.
Since it can't generate its own electricity, it sticks onto large-bodied Pokémon and absorbs static electricity.
It creates barriers from electrified silk that stuns foes. This works as a weapon as well as a defense.
It absorbs the iron it finds in the rock while clinging to the ceiling. It shoots spikes when in danger.
By swinging around its three spiky feelers and shooting spikes, it can obliterate an opponent.
Two bodies comprise a fixed pair. They spin around each other to generate electricity.
A minigear and big gear comprise its body. If the minigear it luanches at a foe doesn't return, it will die.
The minigear spins at high speed. Then energy from the red core charges the minigear to make it ready to fire.
One alone can emit only a trickle of electricity, so a group of them gathes to unleash a powerful electric shock.
It wraps itself around its prey and paralyzes it with electricity from the round spots on its sides. Then it chomps.
It latches onto prey with its sucker mouth, sinking in its fangs and shocking the prey with powerful electricity.
Rumors of its origin are linked to a UFO crash site in the desert 50 years ago.
Apparently, it communicates by flashing its three fingers, but those patterns haven't been decoded.
Its flame is usually out, but it starts shining when it absorbs life force from people or Pokémon.
The spirits it absorbs fuel its baleful fire. It hangs around hospitals waiting for people to pass on.
The spirits burned up in its ominous flame lose their way and wander this world forever.
Its large tusks have a tendency to break, but each time they grow back, they grow in harder and sturdier.
A broken tusk will not grow back, so it diligently sharpens its tusks on river rocks after the end of a battle.
Its tusks are incredibly destructive. They can easily slice through a thick, sturdy steel column every time.
Their snot is a barometer of health. When healthy, their snot is sticky and the power of their ice moves increases.
They love the cold seas of the north. They create pathways around the ocean waters by freezing their own breath.
They are composed of ice crystals. They capture prey with chains of ice, freezing the prey at -148 F.
When it and Karrablast are together, and both receive electrical stimulation, they both evolve.
When its body dries out, it weakens. So it wraps a membrane around itself for protection while it spits poison.
When its opponent can't be paralyzed, it contorts itself with undexpected speed and flops away.
It takes pride in the speed at which it can use moves. What it loses in power, it makes up for in quantity.
Using the long fur on its arms like whips, it launches into combo attacks that, once started, no one can stop.
It runs through the narrow tunnels formed by Excadrill and Onix. It uses its sharp claws to catch prey.
Ancient science fashioned this Pokémon from clay. It's been active for thousands of years.
Golurk were created to protect people and Pokémon. They run on a mysterious energy.
Ignoring their injuries, groups attack by sinking the blades that cover their bodies into their prey.
This pitiless Pokémon commands a group of Pawniard to hound prey into immobility. It then moves in to finish the prey off.
They are known to charge so wildly that if a trainer were toenter their territory, they would send it flying.
It stands up to massive opponents, not out of courage, but out of recklessness. But that is how it gets stronger.
For the sake of its friends, this brave warrior of the sky will not stop battling, even if injured.
Their wings are too tiny to allow them to fly. They guard their posteriors with bones that were gathered by Mandibuzz.
They fly in circles around the sky. When they spot prey, they attack and carry it back to their nest with ease.
It draws in air through its tail, transforms it into fire, and uses it like a tongue. It melts Durant and eats them.
Individuals each play different roles in driving Heatmor, their natural predator, away from their colony.
Lacking sight, it's unaware of its surroundings, so it bumps into things and eats anything that moves.
The two heads do not get along. Whichever head eats more than the other gets to be their leader.
It responds to movement by attacking. This scary, three-headed Pokémon devours everything in its path!.
Said to have been born from the sun, it spews fire from its horns and encases itself in a cocoon of fire when it evolves.
Thought to be an emobiment of the sun, it appeared during a bitterly cold winter and saved Pokémon from freezing..
It has a body and heart of steel. It worked with its allies to punish people when they hurt Pokémon.
Spoken of in legend, this Pokémon used its phenomenal power to destroy a castle in its effort to protect Pokémon.
Legends say this Pokémon confounded opponents with its swift movements.
In every direction it flies, creating winds so powerful, they blow everything away.
As it flies around, it shoots lightning all over the place and causes forest fires. It is therefore disliked.
This legendary Pokémon can scorch the world with fire. It helps those who want to build a world of truth.
This legendary Pokémon can scorch the world with lightning. It assists those who want to build an ideal world.
From the forces of lightning and wind, it creates energy to give nutrients to the soil and make the land abundant.
This legendary ice Pokémon waits for a hero to fill in the missing parts of its body with truth or ideals..
When it is resolute, its body fills with power and it becomes swifter. Its jumps are then too fast to follow.
Its melodies are sung with a special\xfffevocalization method that can control\xfffethe feelings of those who hear it.
Over 300 million years ago, it was feared\xfffeas the strongest of hunters.\xfffeIt has been modified by Team Plasma.
